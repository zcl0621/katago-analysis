/*
Package sgf contains various tools for working with SGF files and the SGF trees
within them. Trees are simply a collection of nodes connected together via
parent and child relationships. Each node can have properties, which are keys
with a slice of values. All keys and values are stored as strings.

In general, functions or methods which require a coordinate expect that
coordinate to be supplied as an SGF string. For example, the string "dd" is the
top left hoshi point. Such strings can be generated by the Point() utility
function; e.g. Point(3, 3) returns "dd".

Nodes can be used to generate boards via node.Board(), but editing a board has
no effect on the node that created it. Creating boards is relatively expensive,
but often unnecessary for simple tasks.

New nodes are generally best created with node.Play().
